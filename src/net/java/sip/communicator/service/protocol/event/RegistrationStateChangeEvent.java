/**
 * Instances of this class represent a  change in the status of the provider

 * <p>
 * Keep in mind that reasons are not localized and services such as the user
 * interface should only show them in a "details box". In the rest of the time,
 * such services should consult the error code and provide corresponding,

 * <p>
 * Note, that we have tried to provide a maximum number of error codes in order
 * to enumerate all possible reason codes that may be returned from servers
 * in the various protocols. Each protocol would only return a subset of these.
