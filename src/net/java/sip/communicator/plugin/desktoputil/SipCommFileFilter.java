/**
 * The purpose of this interface is to provide an generic file filter type for
 * the SipCommFileChooser, which is used either as an AWT FileDialog, either as
 * a Swing JFileChooser.
 *
 * Both of these dialogs use their own filter type, FileFilter (class) for
 * JFileChooser and FilenameFilter (interface) for FileDialog.
 *
 * SipCommFileFilter acts as both an implementation and an heritage from these
 * two filters. To use a your own file filter with a SipCommFileChooser, you
 * just have to extend from SipCommFileFilter and redefine at least the method
 * 'public boolean accept(File f)' which is described in the Java FileFilter
 * class.
 *
 * You won't have to redefine 'public boolean accept(File dir, String name)'
 * from the Java FilenameFilter interface since it's done here: the method is
 * transfered toward the accept method of Java FileFilter class.
